## Code Requirements
You can install Anaconda for python, which solves all the problems.You can use Spyder , as it has best integrated developing environment and is easy to use.

## Description

This a  ML model to detect the cancer cells whether Benign or Malignant.
This a ML model created using  Random Forest  Regressor Model and  with KNN model ,with Naive bayes,with Decision Tree Classification and and Random forest Classification model with dataset of 568 entries.And the results I got is amazing ,the KNN model fits the data well and the prediction is astonishing.The Results through the confusion matrix for KNN found was only 3 incorret predictions out of 57 entries.
The KNN model gives a f1 score of 0.933 and accuracy of 94.7%.And for the Random Forest Classication model confusion matrix is found only 2 incorrect prediction. The f1 score for Random Forest Classification Model is 0.956 with an accuracy of 96.4%.

 After completion of the Machine Learning project, the ML model need to deploy in an application. To deploy the ML model need to save it first. To save the Machine Learning project we can use the pickle or joblib package.Here I have used pickle package of python to load and save the model.The pickle or joblib package saves the model to that address, later on to deploy the model we can simply load the model through the pickle file that I have included here or you can make by running the code.
